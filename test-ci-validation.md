# Hello World - Markdown Test

Simple test markdown file to validate CI markdownlint paths.

## Purpose

This file tests the markdownlint validation in the CI workflow with MD013 disabled to match the global pre-commit configuration.

## Test Items

- Shell script validation
- Python linting and formatting
- HTML validation
- YAML linting  
- Markdown linting

This line is intentionally longer than 80 characters to test that MD013 (line length) is properly disabled in the CI workflow configuration.
